# Java Stream API Practice 🚀

This repository contains various Java 8 **Stream API** practice programs that I have written while learning Java. It covers key concepts and use-cases of Stream API such as:

## ✅ Concepts Covered

- Filtering elements using `.filter()`
- Mapping values using `.map()`
- Sorting streams using `.sorted()`
- Collecting results using `.collect(Collectors.toList())`
- Reducing values using `.reduce()`
- Using `Optional`, `Comparator`, and method references
- Counting vowels, even/odd logic, and more

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each `.java` file contains a different Stream API example or question solution.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is part of my Java learning journey at Naresh IT. I want to share my progress and help others learn Stream API effectively.

## 📌 How to Run

- Clone or download the repo
- Open in Eclipse or any Java IDE
- Run individual `.java` files with a `main()` method

## 🤝 Let's Connect

If you're learning Java too, feel free to collaborate or give suggestions!
