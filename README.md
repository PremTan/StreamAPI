# Java Stream API Practice 🚀

This repository contains my ongoing practice programs focused on **Java 8 Stream API**.  
I'm currently working on solving **50+ real-world and interview-based questions** using Stream API features.

## ✅ Concepts Covered (and Expanding...)

- Filtering elements using `.filter()`
- Mapping values with `.map()`
- Sorting streams using `.sorted()`
- Collecting results via `.collect(Collectors.toList())`
- Reducing values with `.reduce()`
- Using `Optional`, `Comparator`, and method references
- Solving problems like finding unique elements, non-repeated characters, counting vowels, even/odd logic, and much more...

## 🛠️ Work in Progress

🔄 I'm actively updating this repo with new questions regularly.  
Stay tuned for **50+ carefully crafted Stream API problems!**

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each `.java` file is a standalone example demonstrating a specific use-case or question related to the Stream API.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is part of my **Java learning journey at Naresh IT**.  
I believe in learning by doing — and this repository is both my **practice zone** and a **helpful resource** for others exploring Java Streams.

## ▶️ How to Run

- Clone or download the repo
- Open the project in **Eclipse**, **IntelliJ**, or any Java IDE
- Run individual `.java` files (each has a `main()` method)
