# Java Stream API Practice 🚀

This repository contains my ongoing practice programs focused on **Java 8 Stream API**.  
I'm actively solving **70+ real-world and interview-based questions** using Stream API features — with new problems added regularly!

---

## ✅ Concepts Covered (and Expanding...)

- Filtering elements using `.filter()`
- Mapping values with `.map()`
- Sorting streams using `.sorted()`
- Collecting results via `.collect(Collectors.toList())`
- Reducing values with `.reduce()`
- Using `Optional`, `Comparator`, `Map.Entry`, and method references
- Counting frequency, finding duplicates, max/min values, grouping, and much more...
- **String-based logic problems** using streams
- **Custom class object operations**
- **Test-style interview programs**

## 📁 Folder Structure

src/com/
├── custom     → Programs using custom classes and object streams
├── string     → Programs focused on string manipulation using Stream API
└── test       → Miscellaneous and interview-style logic problems



Each `.java` file is standalone with a `main()` method and clear logic focused on a specific stream concept or question.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is part of my **Java learning journey at Naresh IT**.  
I strongly believe in **learning by doing**, and this repository is my hands-on zone to master Stream API.  
It's also built to help other **Java learners, freshers, and interview candidates**.

## 📌 Work in Progress

🔄 I'm actively updating this repo with more questions & logic **daily**.  
✨ **Follow the repo** to stay updated with new additions!

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open the project in **Eclipse**, **IntelliJ**, or any Java IDE
3. Navigate to any `.java` file inside the folders and run it (all files have `main()` methods)
